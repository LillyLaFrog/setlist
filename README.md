# Setlist ðŸŽµðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¶
*A music artist album and event tracker*

This is a **React Native** application I made for my final project for the **Mobile Development** course at **Davis Tech**.  
It was also used in my **DevOps** course to practice **Continuous Integration** using **Azure Pipelines**.

I'm really happy with how it's turned out so far and forward to adding more to it!

## ðŸ”’ API Keys ðŸ”‘ ðŸŽ¹

To get started, create a file named `ApiKeys.js` inside the `constants` folder.  
Follow the layout outlined in the text file in the same folder, and insert your own API keys accordingly.
